The for loop that follows manipulates not the standard I/O streams but rather 
the input and output files accessed through the file pointers in inp and outp . 
Function getc is called repeatedly to take one character at a time from the 
input file, and putc echoes these characters to the output file. When the copy is 
complete, the calls to fclose release the two files after writing an <eof> on the 
output file.
